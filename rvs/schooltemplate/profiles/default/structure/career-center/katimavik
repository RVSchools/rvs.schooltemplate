<p>Not sure about your next step for College or University. Would you like to meet people from all over Canada and&nbsp; put something impressive on your resume? <br />Spend six or nine months getting involved in communities across Canada.<br /><br />For those who may not be familiar with Katimavik, we are a youth leadership<br />and volunteer program. Youth between the ages of 17 – 21 travel to three<br />different provinces across Canada and volunteer for Non-profit organizations<br />for three months each. The youth live with a group of 12 who they travel<br />with, learn with, and grow with. Katimavik gives youth a chance to learn<br />more about Canada through their group (each participant in the group comes<br />from a different province including two francophone’s) and through the<br />communities they visit and volunteer in. In Katimavik youth gain leadership<br />skills, team building skills, French, community involvement, and work<br />experience (in areas they are interested in). The best part is that<br />everything is free, we are not selling a program, we are giving an<br />opportunity which is government funded through Canadian Heritage. <br />&nbsp;<br />For more information see:&nbsp; <a class="external-link" href="http://www.gokatimavik.com/">www.gokatimavik.com</a><br /><br /></p>
