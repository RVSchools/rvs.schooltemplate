<p><strong>ApplyAlberta </strong>is a new, secure, online application and transcript transfer system that students will use to:<br />·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apply to any Alberta public post-secondary institution through one portal, and <br />·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authorize institution(s) to request the transfer of their : <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Alberta Education high school transcripts <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Alberta post-secondary transcripts <br />·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students will not be charged a fee for these transcripts when transferred through ApplyAlberta. ApplyAlberta was developed by Alberta's public post-secondary institutions working in partnership with the provincial government.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Start-up Dates:</strong><br />There will be a phased implementation of ApplyAlberta. By fall 2009, all public universtities, colleges and technical institutes will be using this new application system. See participating institutions at:&nbsp; <a class="external-link" href="https://www.applyalberta.ca/pub/">https://www.applyalberta.ca/pub/</a></p>
<p><br />Students interested in applying &nbsp;now to a post-secondary institution should visit their institution of choice directly. If this institution has implemented ApplyAlberta, there will be a ‘seamless’ transition to the new application process.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
